Library Reader Service (C# Desktop Application)

Library Reader Service is a C# desktop application developed as a university course project.
The main goal of the system is to provide a simple and efficient tool for managing library readers and books.

The application allows users to:

Add, edit, and delete readers

Add, edit, and delete books

Store key information in a structured and accessible format

Navigate through a clear and minimalistic user interface

Manage library data without using a complex database system

The project demonstrates:

Basic principles of object-oriented programming in C#

Work with Windows Forms (or WPF — you can tell me which one you used)

Handling user input and form events

Simple data persistence (files, lists, or any other method used)

Understanding of software design and UI/UX basics

This project showcases practical skills in building small management systems and creating functional desktop tools using the .NET ecosystem.
